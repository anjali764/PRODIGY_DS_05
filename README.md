# 🚗 Traffic Accident Data Analysis

This project was created as part of my internship at **Prodigy InfoTech**, focusing on data analysis and visualization using Python. The objective was to explore and analyze traffic accident data to uncover insights, detect patterns, and visualize key aspects influencing road safety.

---

## 📁 Dataset

* The dataset contains detailed records of traffic accidents.
* Features include date/time, location, accident severity, and weather conditions.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used

* `Python`
* `pandas`, `numpy`
* `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
* `datetime`

---

## 🔄 Project Workflow

1. **Data Loading** – Imported the traffic dataset.
2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** – Handled missing values, parsed datetime, and corrected datatypes.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:

   * Visualized accident frequency by hour, day, and month
   * Analyzed accident severity distribution
   * Identified weather and light conditions related to accidents
4. **Insights Extraction** – Derived actionable insights from the visual trends.

---

## ✅ Key Learnings

* Learned effective techniques for time-based data analysis.
* Gained experience using visualization tools to communicate complex data stories.
* Enhanced my ability to clean and transform real-world datasets.

---

## 📊 Visualizations Included

* Accidents by time of day
* Accident severity pie/bar charts
* Heatmaps of accidents by weekday and hour
* Correlation matrix for numerical features
